			"Take a Bullet For the Country" scrapes data from the <a href="http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/">Gun Violence Archive</a> "Last 72 Hours" page and filters that data based on the location of the user when they open the web page. The web page generates a bullet per gun-related incident and renders that data to the screen.
